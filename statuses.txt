Tired of being the person who helps everyone, making ppl laugh, and bein someones shoulder to cry on , cuz when i cry or need help i feel alone

I close my eyes, and I can see a better day. I close my eyes, and pray. I know there's sunshine beyond that rain. I know there's good times beyond that pain (:

I can't explain what is wrong or why the tears are falling, because I don't know the answer myself other than,. I have depression & depression needs no reason

I hate it when you realize that you mean nothing or damn near nothing to someone who means everything to you.

People say i am so pretty, BUT I'm just a girl who has hid their tears and anger to make other people happy.

Sometimes it's best to stay quiet. Except the silence can speak volumes without ever saying a word.

'..^^Never ignore a person Who loves you, Cares for you And misses you, Because one day, You might wake up and realize You lost the moon While Counting Stars....

One moment in my life, I had everything I wanted, everything I needed. Just one moment later, I realize that it's all gone. What went wrong??

Why is it that when u know u love someone that u cant have you end up loving them even more???

says that its not the heartbreak that kills you, the pain comes from all the memories that you have.

Someone once told me that you have to cry all the tears out of your heart to make room for smiles :) So its okay to cry no matter what.. Remember that :) xXx

is tired of feeling alone yet scared of letting anyone in

When I cry no one cares, yet when the person next to me sheds one tear everyone trys to help
