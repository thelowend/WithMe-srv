        "You know when you are happy when you start to delete all your angst reposts and likes on tumblr.",
        "So there's this new-ish person at work (though she's one of the assistant managers) and she just makes me feel so appreciated and reminds me how much of a hard worker I am and it makes me feel amazing. Especially when most of the time I don't feel appreciated or recognized.... Even though I'm modest about it, it's a good feeling. Like, even if it's not that busy of a day and I'm moderately working hard, she tells me what a good worker I am. We need more of that in workplaces.",
        "Lately, Iâ€™ve been feeling like, little by little, Iâ€™m finally learning to love myself.",
        "My puppy sleeps with her tongue poking out a little and it's the cutest thing ever",
        "OH MY GOD Iâ€™M SO HAPPY I JUST MADE GSHAGSGJAHAHHHA A GIF!! AND ITâ€™S BEAUTIFUL! LEMME POST IT FOR YOU GUYS! Iâ€™M SO FREAKING HAPPY BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THIS WASNâ€™T A WASTE OF TIME!",

        "*FANGIRLS OVER CURE PASSION* AAAAAAH SHE'S SO GREAT",
        "I was gonna be sad about it but then I remembered the huge smile my best friend had on his face after he got off the phone this morning. He got the house he wanted. I'm so proud of & happy for him. He's been through a great deal of things & I haven't seen him this happy in a long time. It almost brought tears to my eyes. It's hard to be around that sort of pure joy & not have a little rub off on yourself. ðŸ˜Š",
        "It's so much easier to get through the day when you have someone who tells you that they're glad that you're alive. :)",
        "i am so lucky to have the friends that i have :)",
        "first text post from my new laptop woooop wooop",

        "slightly drunk (more like tipsy) and ridiculously happy. i love my friends and my second family",
        "Today someone said to me 'Well you always look pretty but particularly right now' and it was just so sweet and genuine and I never know what to say to compliments but it was just lovely oh gosh",
        "Just got a call about the job application I submitted & I have a phone interview for Monday!! I feel so relieved!",
        "Do you ever take pics of yourself while feeling a bit self-conscious, but then look at them and go 'Wow... I'd do me'? Best feeling in the world.",
        "Has anyone ever gotten really excited because they know they are going the right direction and know that their future is so bright that you just know you can't fail?  Well I have and I get like this everyday.",
        "Tickets for Jack Ryan became available for booking today. I'm going to the premiere this Friday and then again next Wednesday. <3",
        "Shoutsout to that anonymous follower who told me nice things and made me happy and my day better",
        "I hope you're able to smile today",
        "I think my life is pretty darn great right now. Have a job and a girlfriend, going to university that I actually like so far and improving relations with my family.",
        "Smiling like crazy because the doctor I work under at my university just invited me to the White Coat Ceremony!! It's where the new med students get their white lab coats and get inaugurated and I get to go see that! He said 'I thought you might enjoy it since that'll be you sometime soon.' I'm dying. This is AMAZING!!!! Ahh! Perks of working at school- great connects ;D plus everyone I work with is super friendly.",
        "i'm especially happy today :D",
        "One of my favorite feelings comes with making people proud of me:D",

        "just trying to be happy with myself but I can't",
        "It was the worst thing seeing you cry today. See, it was the first time I had ever seen you cry, and it was because of me.",
        "Tfw u wish u had someone to talk to about your depression but you're also painfully unable to admit how bad it's gotten so u just lay in bed and suffer",
        "is there any worse feeling than being ignored by all your friends at once?",
        "I always convince myself that I'm doing something wrong or that someones doing me wrong and it's getting so mentally exhausting.",
        "i relasped this week and i still dont feel much, i want help but im just not finding it, but fuck me right",
        "wow...love.....never doing that again",
        "Things keep slowly approaching ok and then immediately taking a nose dive",
        "I am fucking heartbroken. That I don't have more queer female friends but the first lesbian friend I, a lesbian, ever had was for nearly five years my emotionally abusive girlfriend.",
        "Iâ€™m always trying to be better. A better friend, a better girlfriend, a better daughter. Or maybe I just think Iâ€™m trying, when in reality, Iâ€™m not helping anyone at all. Iâ€™m just scared I canâ€™t do it. That I canâ€™t or just wonâ€™t be better. That this is all there is.",
        "is it possible to miss someone youâ€™ve never met",
        "one thing iâ€™ve learned is that fictional characters will always treat you better than irl people and thatâ€™s a sad thing. fictional characters will never leave you on read, if you need them theyâ€™re there and worst of all they can never actually hug you.",
        "The thing is, I used to be really happy, I used to make other people happy too, and I miss that. I miss being with a group of people and not feeling like Iâ€™m bringing everyone down. Like things are worse when Iâ€™m there instead of better.",
        "The worst part was when things finally started to get better and all I felt was empty",
        "When it did become a hobby to see how low I could possibly feel??",
        "Someone I graduated highschool with just recently passed away and I wasn't close with them or anything as a matter of fact I barely knew him. But we had classes and I believe I'd spoken a few times to him. He was particularly close with a close friend of mine though. Its just put me in a weird mental spot... Rest in peace man...I hope you're doing better now",
        "I'm thankful that no one really knows who I am. I don't want to be known. Because to be known, is to be used. And I don't want to be used...no matter how lonely it is being a stranger.",
        "I'm filled with bottled up anger and resentment, most of all sadness And the only way I know how to release it and let someone know how I feel is by saying 'omG! I want to die rn lololol' And, as expected it isn't taken seriously. It is meant to sound like a joke. And, of course, my friend will reply 'SAME. LOL' Okay. I walked myself into that one. As always, though, I will back my courage into a corner and trap it, not allowing it to come inside of me and tell people how that wasn't really a joke, and that I say 'I want to no longer exist' to myself, every single day. No one has to know.",
        "My son passed away Oct. 23rd. Its now May 14th (mothers day) and I still hurt like the day it happened. Mothers day has been hard for me already for the past 6yrs due to my miscarriage. Now 6yrs later its even more hard on me because I dont get to spend mothers day with my #1 little guy who made me a mother. My heart is broken and it hurts so bad.",
        "I just wish I was loved, pretty, and important. But at the same time I don't mind knowing I'm not, because I love the thought of death.",
        "constantly looking for the slightest hint that im missed",
        "i miss christmas when i was like 6 and id have to sleep early on christmas eve because if santa knows im awake he wont come and once 6 am hit id run down the stairs and notice santa ate the cookies and drank the milk and id see presents all over the place and my parents would be half asleep still taking sleep out of their eyes but they loved seeing me and my siblings open presents and now my christmas is filled with stress and bills and buying other people presents that i cant even enjoy my holidays. i hate growing up and christmas is the biggest reminder that im truly not a child anymore and how much i'll miss that feeling",
        "Iâ€™m scaring myself againâ€¦ About halfway through my previous relationship I started to notice I had the beginnings of an eating disorder. Now Iâ€™m having to really force myself to eat even once a day. Iâ€™m scared to admit it to my loved ones because I donâ€™t want to drive away the most important people in my life. Iâ€™m just scared and crying and it hit me today that even though it feels like Iâ€™m thriving things will most likely only go downhill from where Iâ€™m at.",
